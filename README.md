# BullieverDiamondMilitiaBadge2022
Twitter plugin that adds a badge on the PFP of the Bullievers

## A Little back story
Recently to increase the engagement on Twitter they created the “Diamond Militia”. 
A group that everyone can join, and get free NFT wearable just by engaging on twitter.
The more people engage, the more points they get and the higher they rise in the leaderboard.
Each rank is represented by a badge, and I thought it might be a good idea to see it directly on Twitter. 
That’s why, I created my first Chrome extension.
